INTERPRETER :
 
             * It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code.
               however, the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers.

             * No object code i generated, hence are memory efficient.

             * Programming language like javascript, python, ruby use interpreter.


COMPILER    :

             * Compiler usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code.
               however, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreter.

             * Generates Object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory.

             * Programming language like c, c++ , java use compiler.
